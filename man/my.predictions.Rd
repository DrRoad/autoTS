\title{Make predictions with desired algorithms, combine them with observed data and gather everything
in one final dataframe. If you want to save time, skip the sarima algorithm which is much slower}
\usage{
my.predictions(prepedTS, algos = list("my.prophet", "my.ets",
  "my.sarima", "my.tbats", "my.bats", "my.stlm", "my.shortterm"),
  bagged = F, n_pred = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{prepedTS}{A list created by the \code{prepare.ts()} function}

\item{algos}{A list containing the algorithms to be implemented}

\item{bagged}{A boolean indicating weather a "bagged" estimator (simple average of all algorithm) should be computed.
Using this option will overwrite the provided list of algorithms to implement them all}

\item{n_pred}{Int number of periods to forecast forward (eg n_pred = 12 will lead to one year of prediction for monthly time series)}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing : date, actual observed values, one column per used algorithm, and
a column indicating the type of measure (mean prediction, upper or lower bound of CI)
}

Make predictions with desired algorithms, combine them with observed data and gather everything
